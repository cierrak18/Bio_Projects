Project Overview
------------------------------------------------------------
This project focuses on building, training, testing, and evaluating
a machine learning model to predict diabetes using Logistic Regression
implemented with Apache Spark MLlib and PySpark.

The project is designed as a hands-on learning experience where the
user practices alongside guided lectures. Emphasis is placed on
practical implementation rather than theoretical discussion.
